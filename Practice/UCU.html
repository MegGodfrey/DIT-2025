            <h3>The Case of expired Industrial Security Information System</h3> 
Currently, many citizens in Uganda are using expired ICT for all kinds of services. This was because the Government of Uganda through the National Information Technology Authority (NIRA) and through Internal Affairs State Minister, Gen David Muhoozi has said the national Identity cards that expire in 2024 will remain valid for another year. 
<br>“This exercise [the renewal and mass registration] was supposed to commence on 01 June 2024; however, we experienced challenges of delays in procurement and establishment of the new Industrial Security Information System,” he said. He added, “The key items on the critical path have to be in place before commencement of the exercise and they include delivery of 5,650 biometric registration kits, delivery of blank cards, data center, hardware and five software modules.” Accordingly, the Government of Uganda has now embarked on a project called “The Industrial Security Information Systems” aimed at delivering a comprehensive National Identification cards to the citizens with synchronized information. The minister said despite inordinate delays in renewal of national IDs, steps are being taken to ensure all persons eligible for voting in the 2026 elections will have their details captured and issued with IDs to participate in the voting exercise.<br>
