        <h2>My coding Story</h2>
        <p>Meg was a quiet boy from a small town, known more for curiosity 
            than conversation, but his eyes always glowed when screens lit 
            up before him. At age ten, he dismantled his first radio, trying 
            to understand the logic behind sound, and by thirteen, he had built 
            a small website using free internet tutorials. Nights became his 
            classrooms and coffee his closest ally. He’d code until dawn, debugging 
            like a detective chasing truth through lines of syntax. In university, 
            while others partied, Meg was buried in Python scripts and networking 
            simulations, building bots that could automate his assignments. His 
            projects soon drew attention from lecturers who saw a spark beyond grades. 
            One day, he created an AI system that could predict market shifts for 
            small African startups—an innovation that went viral across Uganda and 
            beyond. Tech companies started noticing the young genius from the East 
            African highlands, offering internships he turned down to continue building 
            his dream project. Meg believed that code wasn’t just for profit but for 
            purpose—to solve real problems around him. He trained village kids to 
            code under tree shades, using old laptops powered by solar panels, saying, 
            <em>“Innovation isn’t about where you are, but what you do with what you have.”</em> 
            His resilience made him a digital beacon for young Africans who saw 
            themselves in his story. He faced rejections, broken code, and sleepless 
            nights that felt endless, yet each bug fixed became a victory toward mastery. 
            When the global hackathon circuit heard of him, Meg entered and shocked the 
            world—winning first place with an app that optimized power usage for rural 
            homes. His name echoed through blogs, conferences, and coding communities as 
            <em>“the boy who turned passion into impact.”</em> Still humble, he’d smile and say, 
            <em>“I’m just a learner.”</em> Today, Meg mentors others, writing open-source 
            tools and speaking about coding ethics, creativity, and perseverance. From a 
            dusty room to digital glory, his journey stands as proof that genius is not born 
            in Silicon Valley—it can rise from anywhere, even the quiet corners of Uganda, 
            where one boy turned curiosity into code that changed the world.</p>
